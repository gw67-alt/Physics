If all grouped qubits are XOR'd it'd be the range/probability of each value per qubit, group them in different ways with gates, do combinatorics with the gates


So qubit A is int 1 and qubit B is int 2 it'd have 0.1 and 0.2 probabilities if calibrated to int 10, merge those two together with a gate and it'd have a surface probability of 0.15 and local binding gives the result of 0.15*10 = 1.5*2 = 3

So qubit A is int 1 and qubit B is int 12 it'd have 0.01 and 0.12 probabilities if calibrated to int 10, merge those two together with a gate and it'd have a surface probability of 0.065

0.065*10 = 6.5*2 = 13
