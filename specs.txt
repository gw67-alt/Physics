255 hyperfine states in 1 physical qubit could match a byte to many other bytes(other qubits) via an indifference operator from high performance NMR Radar. The speed boost is linear and can search qubit volume in bytes instantly, the only performance metric I can quantify is memory performance. DDR5 memory can read a 1kb file in 20 nanoseconds which is equivalent to an 8000 qubit machine yet the quantum machine could do the same feat in a picosecond which makes the quantum computers memory capability equivalent to DDR12 or 32,000 times faster.
