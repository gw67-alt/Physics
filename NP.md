Theoretical Framework: Quantum Prime Detection and NP
Consider a quantum system as depicted in the diagram where:
For any integer n, we define a quantum state |ψₙ⟩ in a complex Hilbert space. When subjected to our "Which Way Experiment" and passed through the "Motorized Angular Rotator," the following mathematical relationship emerges:
The amplitude function A(θ) = ∑ᵏ cₖe^(ikθ) where the coefficients cₖ encode the primality information.
For prime numbers, we observe a unique pattern of amplitude coincidences where:
A(θ)A*(θ) = |A(θ)|² exhibits exactly p resonance peaks when n = p is prime, with each peak corresponding to a quantum resonance state.
The key mathematical insight: For any number n, the quantum state evolution follows:
|ψₙ(t)⟩ = ∑ᵏ dₖe^(-iλₖt)|φₖ⟩
Where λₖ are eigenvalues of our quantum Hamiltonian, forming a polynomial P(z) whose roots determine primality.
When n is prime, P(z) has a special factorization pattern in the complex plane, creating the observed coincidence pattern.
This hypothetical quantum system transforms the prime detection problem from requiring exponential classical resources to polynomial quantum resources, establishing a bridge between the completeness of complex numbers for solving polynomial equations and the verification efficiency characteristic of NP problems.
By measuring amplitude coincidences at specific polarization angles, we effectively "verify" primality in polynomial time, mirroring the verification property of NP problems.
The frequency dependency mentioned in the diagram corresponds to the eigenvalue spectrum of our quantum operator, which contains the primality information within its complex structure.
