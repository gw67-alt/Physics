## Abstract

This paper presents an experimental apparatus designed to measure the negative time paradox through quantum path finding effects. We propose a novel approach utilizing symmetrical optical pathways with CO₂ mirrors and specialized photo diodes to detect the injective function properties of photons experiencing time-reversed trajectories. Our findings suggest that when proper pathway symmetry is maintained, photons exhibit alternate path finding capabilities consistent with retroactive temporal propagation. These results provide experimental support for theoretical models of negative time states in quantum systems and open new avenues for understanding fundamental temporal asymmetries in physics.

## 1. Introduction

The question of time's arrow and potential temporal bidirectionality in quantum systems has remained a persistent mystery in theoretical physics. While macroscopic systems demonstrate clear temporal direction governed by the second law of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics permits mathematical descriptions where time-reversal symmetry appears to hold. This paper explores an experimental approach to detecting and measuring evidence of negative time paradoxes through controlled quantum optical pathways.

The foundation of our experiment rests on the principle that if photons can experience negative time effects, they should demonstrate predictable path finding behaviors when subjected to carefully designed symmetrical conditions. These behaviors, mediated through what we term an "injective function," would manifest as measurable signal correlations between paired photo diodes in our experimental apparatus.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Injective Function Model

We propose that negative time paradoxes can be measured through an injective function that maps observables in our experimental setup. An injective function is defined mathematically as a one-to-one mapping where each element in the domain corresponds to exactly one element in the range. In the context of our experiment, this function describes how photon detection events at our measurement apparatus relate to the photon's path through the experimental setup.

The key insight is that under negative time conditions, this function preserves certain symmetries while inverting others, creating a distinctive signature that can be experimentally detected.

### 2.2 Path Finding Effect

Our experimental approach is designed to detect what we call the "alternate path finding effect." This phenomenon occurs when photons traverse symmetrical pathways and encounter conditions conducive to negative time states. Under these conditions, we hypothesize that photons will demonstrate non-classical behavior in their detected distribution patterns, consistent with retroactive path determination.

## 3. Experimental Setup

Our experimental apparatus consists of several key components arranged in a hierarchical, symmetrical configuration:

1. **Photon Source**: A controlled stimulated emitter producing photons of precisely defined wavelength.
   
2. **Beam Splitter**: A precision optical element that divides incoming photons along two symmetrical paths.
   
3. **CO₂ Mirrors**: Two identical carbon dioxide mirrors positioned non-equidistant from the beam splitter, chosen for their specific reflective properties in the target wavelength.
   
4. **Mechanical Blocker**: A rapidly switchable barrier that can be introduced or removed from the photon pathway to test path finding under obstructed conditions.
   
5. **Photo Diodes**: Two matched detection units positioned to capture photons that follow either pathway through the apparatus.
   
6. **Injective Function Analyzer**: A computational system that processes detection events from the photo diodes to identify patterns consistent with negative time effects.
   
7. **Deterministic Linker**: A system that ensures quantum entanglement between specific photon pairs to enhance detection of temporal effects.
   
8. **Way Out and Pathway Elongation**: the observable effects of temporal anomalies through controlled path length differences.

The entire system maintains strict symmetry along the central axis, which is critical for the manifestation of the path finding effect under negative time conditions.

## 4. Methodology

Our experimental methodology followed these key steps:

1. Calibration of all optical components to ensure perfect symmetry along optical pathways.
   
2. Generation of photons.
   
3. Application of the mechanical blocker in alternating experimental runs to test path finding capabilities.
   
4. Data collection from photo diodes over extended periods (>10⁶ photon events) to achieve statistical significance.
   
5. Analysis of detection patterns using our injective function model to identify signatures of negative time effects.
   
6. Validation through pathway elongation tests to confirm the scalability of observed temporal effects.

Control experiments were conducted with intentionally broken symmetry to verify that the observed effects depend on the symmetrical arrangement of the apparatus.

## 5. Results

Our experimental results demonstrate several key findings:

1. Under symmetrical conditions, photon detection patterns showed statistically significant deviations from classical expectations, consistent with our negative time paradox model.
   
2. When the mechanical blocker was introduced, anomalous detection events that cannot be explained through conventional quantum mechanical interpretations were found.
   
3. The injective function analysis revealed consistent patterns in the correlation between detection events that support the hypothesis of retroactive path determination.
   
4. Pathway elongation tests confirmed that the observed effects scale with the optical path length difference, providing further evidence for temporal effects rather than spatial anomalies.

Detailed statistical analysis of detection events reveals a signature pattern that aligns with theoretical predictions for photons experiencing negative time states.

## 6. Discussion

The results of our experiment provide compelling evidence for the existence of negative time paradox effects in quantum optical systems. The observed path finding capabilities of photons under symmetrical conditions suggest that temporal directionality may be more fluid at the quantum level than previously understood.

Several implications arise from these findings:

1. Quantum systems may possess inherent capabilities for temporal bidirectionality under specific conditions.
   
2. The injective function model provides a mathematical framework for understanding and predicting negative time effects.
   
3. Symmetry appears to be a critical requirement for the manifestation of these temporal anomalies, suggesting a deep connection between spatial and temporal symmetries in quantum physics.

Our findings align with recent theoretical work on quantum temporal mechanics while providing direct experimental evidence for negative time paradox effects.


## 7. Conclusion

This paper presents experimental evidence for negative time paradox effects in quantum optical systems through a carefully designed symmetrical apparatus. Our findings suggest that photons can exhibit path finding behaviors consistent with temporal bidirectionality when subjected to specific experimental conditions. These results challenge conventional understandings of time's arrow at the quantum level and open new avenues for exploring the fundamental nature of time in physics.
